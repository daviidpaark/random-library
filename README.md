# Random Library

A Spicetify custom app that displays your saved Spotify albums and followed artists in a fast, shuffled, filterable grid with on-demand discography exploration, smart edition prioritization, and random discovery. Find it in the left sidebar under the shuffle icon.

## Features

- **Standardized Modes**
  - **`Albums`** — Instant local library view of all your saved albums.
  - **`Artists`** — Shuffled grid of all the artists you follow with instant local loading.
- **Symmetric Randomization**
  - In **Albums** mode: Click **`Random Album`** to pick and open a random album from your saved collection.
  - In **Artists** mode: Click **`Random Artist`** to pick a random followed artist and open their complete discography.
- **In-App Random Navigation History (`◀ Previous` / `Next ▶`)**
  - Seamlessly step backward and forward through your past random artist rolls without exiting the app.
  - Interactive step counter (e.g. `3 of 5`) and instant 0ms cached loading.
- **On-Demand Artist Discography & Native Release Filters**
  - Click any followed artist to open their complete discography right inside the app.
  - Native Spotify catalog categories:
    - `All`
    - `✓ In Library` (Isolates all releases by this artist saved in your library)
    - `Albums` (Studio albums)
    - `Singles & EPs`
    - `Alternative Editions` (Releases featuring multiple expanded or deluxe editions)
- **Smart Edition & Deluxe Prioritization**
  - Automatically deduplicates multiple versions of the same album (standard, deluxe, expanded, anniversary, remastered).
  - Prioritizes your exact saved library version if present; otherwise defaults to the most complete Deluxe/Expanded edition.
  - Includes an interactive **`Edition ▾`** dropdown on album cards to switch between alternative releases on the fly.
  - Visual **`✓`** badge on covers and dropdown items indicating library status.
- **Streamlined Artwork & Card Format (Shared with Release List)**
  - Unobstructed album art with smooth hover scale (`1.03x`), sliding green Play (▶) button, and `✓` in-library badge.
  - Dedicated bottom metadata row with a release type badge (`ALBUM` or `SINGLE / EP`) and an interactive edition switcher.
  - Sleek hover elevation (`translateY(-3px)`) and subtle translucent borders.
- **Continuous Filter Randomization** — Selected release filters (e.g. *Albums*, *Singles & EPs*, or *In Library*) persist across **Random Artist** rolls, enabling continuous randomized discovery within a specific category.
- **Instant Library Sync / Refresh** — Click **`Refresh`** to sync newly saved albums and followed artists from Spotify in real time (also clears random navigation history).
- **Fluid Responsive Grid Scaling** — Cards, icons, and avatars automatically scale from ultra-wide & 4K displays down to compact split-screen windows.
- **Persistent Shuffle** — Shuffle order is preserved across app relaunches and sessions.
- **Search & Sort**
  - Real-time debounced search by album title or artist name.
  - Multi-column sort options: *Shuffled*, *Album A–Z / Z–A*, or *Artist A–Z / Z–A*.
- **Play on Hover** — Hover over any album or artist card and click the green play button to start playback immediately.
